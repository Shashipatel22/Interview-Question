1 - what is IAAS

>>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is also known as Hardware as a service. the cloud provider provides the Infrastructure to the developers
like network, storage, virtualization,servers can managed by cloud provider

>>users are managed by operating system and middle ware, runtime data application all are managed by developers
>>by using IAAS to develop the application is very hard by compared to PAAS
Advantages:-
1-controling is high because you controlled
2-cost saving
3-scalibility. 
4-faster time to market
5-expand as you grow
6-tight security
7-anytime any where access
Disadvantages:-
1-no internet no work
2-privacy is limited
3-virtualization depend

2 - what PAAS
 
 >>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete cloud environment that includes everything developers need to build, run, and manage applications—from servers and 
 operating systems to all the networking, storage, middleware, tools, and more.
 
3 - what is SAAS
 
 >>SAAS is pre-existed application that applications are accessible through internet connection and web-browsers 
 like google chrome, gmail, mozila browser, salesforce
 
4 - Define and explain the three basic types of cloud services and the AWS products that are built based on them?

>>The three basic types of cloud services are:

Computing
Storage
Networking
Here are some of the AWS products that are built based on the three cloud service types:

Computing - These include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto-Scaling, and Lightsail.

Storage - These include S3-simple service storage, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System.

Networking - These include VPC, Amazon CloudFront, Route53

5 - what is virtualization

>>Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, 
storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs)

6 - What are the different types of virtualization in AWS, and what are the differences between them?

>>Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
It is a fully virtualized hardware, where all the virtual machines act separate from each other. These virtual machines boot by executing a master boot record 
in the root block device of your image.
>>Paravirtualization (PV)
Paravirtualization-GRUB is the bootloader that boots the PV AMIs. The PV-GRUB chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.
>>Paravirtualization on HVM
PV on HVM helps operating systems take advantage of storage and network I/O available through the host.

7 - Name some of the AWS services that are not region-specific

>>AWS services that are not region-specific are:

IAM
Route 53
Web Application Firewall 
CloudFront

8 - what is VPC

>>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security. 
Get started by setting up your VPC in the AWS service console.

>>Vpc is logical boundary
>>vpc id is globally uniqe
>>you can stop the particular ip one ec2 to another ip through routing table in peering
 
9 - What is the relation between the Availability Zone and Region?

>>AWS regions are separate geographical areas, like the US-West 1 (North California) and Asia South (Mumbai). On the other hand, availability zones
are the areas that are present inside the regions. These are generally isolated zones that can replicate themselves whenever required.

10  - what is VPC Perrring

>>A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network

>>you can also create the vpc peering one region mumbai to another region ohio like this
>>you can also vpc peering one account to another account

===disadvantages of peering

>>increase in the vpc will increase in the vpc peerings
>>each vpc needs a vpg for vpn connections

11 -   what is nat-gateway

>>A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your 
VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances
 
12 - what is NAT-Instance

>>NAT-A NAT (Network Address Translation) instance is, like a bastion host, an EC2 instance that lives in your public subnet. A NAT instance, however, allows your 
private instances outgoing connectivity to the internet while at the same time blocking inbound traffic from the internet

13 - What are the differences between NAT Gateways and NAT Instances?
 
NAT-Gateway
1 - nat gateway managed by aws 
2 - nat gateway canot assigned security groups
3 - nat gateway highly availble
4 - nat gateway bandwidth is upto 45 mbps
5 - nat gateway perfomance is good

NAT-Instance
1 - nat instance managed by you
2 - nat instance can assignes security groups
3 - nat instance is also highly availble
4 - nat instance bandwidth is depends on instnace bandwidth
5 - nat instance performance compared to nat gateway is average

14 - what is Vpc End-point

>>A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an 
internet gateway,NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
 
 15 - what is gateway end-point

>>gateway end-point is a gateway that you specific as a target for a route in your table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service

16 - what is firewall

firewall is security group it is used to control the incoming and outgoing traffic

>>firewall two types

1-stateful firewall
>>it is two-way handshake  process

2-stateless firewall
>>it is not two-way handshake

17 - what is NACL

>>A network access control list (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

>>when you created vpc automatically create nacl 
>>if anyone want say to change something nacl first ask send a mail 
>>don't do changes in nacl in production environment
>>need to add every rule in inbound and outbound  -->if you add ssh in inbound it will not allow so you need to add outbound also
 
18 - What is OpenVPN used for?

Open source OpenVPN uses VPN technologies to secure and encrypt data sent over the internet. Its custom VPN protocol uses SSL/TLS for key exchange. 
Since its creation in 2001 it has become the de facto standard in the open source networking space with over 60 million downloads 
 
19 - What is a transit gateway?

A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. As your cloud infrastructure 
expands globally,inter-Region peering connects transit gateways together using the AWS Global Infrastructure. 
 
20 - Is there any other alternative tool to log into the cloud environment other than console?

Putty
AWS CLI for Linux
AWS CLI for Windows
AWS CLI for Windows CMD
AWS SDK
Eclipse

21 - What is Amazon EC2?

EC2 is short for Elastic Compute Cloud, and it provides scalable computing capacity. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware, leading to faster
development and deployment of applications.You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking, 
and manage storage. It can scale up or down to handle changes in requirements, reducing the need to forecast traffic. EC2 provides virtual computing environments 
called “instances.”

22 - what is AMI In AWS

>>An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify 
an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same configuration. 
 
>>AMI id is different of every region and every image
>>you can use in production mostly use already created AMIs

23 - You are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?

>>Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. 
They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don’t see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn’t been published in 
your region yet. However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services

24 - what is authentication and authriozation

>>authentication your accessing or login into the applicatio or portal entry only
>>authrozation is nothing but you should be assign some roles are features

25 - Define Amazon EC2 regions and availability zones?

>>Availability zones are geographically separate locations. As a result, failure in one zone has no effect on EC2 instances in other zones. When it comes to regions, 
they may have one or more availability zones.This configuration also helps to reduce latency and costs

26 - Explain Amazon EC2 root device volume?

>>The image that will be used to boot an EC2 instance is stored on the root device drive. This occurs when an Amazon AMI runs a new EC2 instance. 
And this root device volume is supported by EBS or an instance store. In general, the root device data on Amazon EBS is not affected by the lifespan of an 
EC2 instance

27 - Mention the different types of instances in  Amazon EC2 and explain its features.

>>General Purpose Instances: They are used to compute a range of workloads and aid in the allocation of processing, memory, and networking resources.
>>Compute Optimized Instances: These are ideal for compute-intensive applications. They can handle  batch processing workloads, high-performance web servers, 
machine learning inference, and various other tasks
>>Memory Optimized: They process workloads that handle massive datasets in memory and deliver them quickly.
>>Accelerated Computing: It aids in the execution of floating-point number calculations, data pattern matching, and graphics processing. These functions are 
carried out using hardware accelerators.
>>Storage Optimised: They handle tasks that require sequential read and write access to big data sets on local storage

28 - What do you understand by 'changing' in Amazon EC2?

>>To make limit administration easier for customers, Amazon EC2 now offers the option to switch from the current 'instance count-based limitations' to the new 
'vCPU Based restrictions.' As a result, when launching a combination of instance types based on demand, utilization is measured in terms of the number of vCPUs.

29 - How do you upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime?
You can upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime using the following steps of migration:

Open EC2 console
Choose Operating System AMI
Launch an instance with the new instance type
Install all the updates
Install applications
Test the instance to see if it’s working
If working, deploy the new instance and replace the older instance
Once it’s deployed, you can upgrade or downgrade the system with near-zero downtime.

30 - What are the tools and techniques that you can use in AWS to identify if you are paying more than you should be, and how to correct it?
You can know that you are paying the correct amount for the resources that you are using by employing the following resources:

Check the Top Services Table
It is a dashboard in the cost management console that shows you the top five most used services. This will let you know how much money you are 
spending on the resources in question.Cost Explorer
There are cost explorer services available that will help you to view and analyze your usage costs for the last 13 months. You can also get a cost
forecast for the upcoming three months.AWS Budgets
This allows you to plan a budget for the services. Also, it will enable you to check if the current plan meets your budget and the details of how you 
use the services.Cost Allocation Tags
This helps in identifying the resource that has cost more in a particular month. It lets you organize your resources and cost allocation tags to keep 
track of your AWS costs.

31 -  What is the difference between a Spot Instance, an On-demand Instance, and a Reserved Instance?

>>Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that users can use at a reduced cost.
>>When you use on-demand instances, you must pay for computing resources without making long-term obligations.
>>Reserved instances, on the other hand, allow you to specify attributes such as instance type, platform, tenancy, region, and availability zone. 
Reserved instances offer significant reductions and capacity reservations when instances in certain availability zones are used.

32 -Define Snapshots in Amazon Lightsail?

The point-in-time backups of EC2 instances, block storage drives, and databases are known as snapshots. They can be produced manually or automatically at any moment. 
Your resources can always be restored using snapshots, even after they have been created. 
These resources will also perform the same tasks as the original ones from which the snapshots were made.

33 - How do you set up a system to monitor website metrics in real-time in AWS?
>>Amazon CloudWatch helps you to monitor the application status of various AWS services and custom events. It helps you to monitor:

State changes in Amazon EC2
Auto-scaling lifecycle events
Scheduled events
AWS API calls
Console sign-in events
amazon cloud watch

34 - With specified private IP addresses, can an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance be launched? If so, which Amazon service makes it possible?

>>Yes. Utilizing VPC makes it possible (Virtual Private Cloud).

35 - What is an Elastic Transcoder?

>>To support multiple devices with various resolutions like laptops, tablets, and smartphones, we need to change the resolution and format of the video. 
This can be done easily by an AWS Service tool called the Elastic Transcoder, which is a media transcoding in the cloud that exactly lets us do the needful. 
It is easy to use, cost-effective, and highly scalable for businesses and developers.

36 - On an EC2 instance, an application of yours is active. Once the CPU usage on your instance hits 80%, you must reduce the load on it.What strategy do you 
use to complete the task?

>>It can be accomplished by setting up an autoscaling group to deploy additional instances, when an EC2 instance's CPU use surpasses 80% and by
allocating traffic across instances via the creation of an application load balancer and the designation of EC2 instances as target instances.

37 - What are the different types of EC2 instances based on their costs?
The three types of EC2 instances are:

On-demand Instance
It is cheap for a short time but not when taken for the long term
Spot Instance
It is less expensive than the on-demand instance and can be bought through bidding. 
Reserved Instance
If you are planning to use an instance for a year or more, then this is the right one for you

38 - What Are Some of the Security Best Practices for Amazon EC2?

>>Security best practices for Amazon EC2 include using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources; restricting access by only allowing 
trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance; only opening up those permissions you require, and disabling password-based logins for instances 
launched from your AMI.

39 - What are the common types of AMI designs?
There are many types of AMIs, but some of the common AMIs are:

Fully Baked AMI
Just Enough Baked AMI (JeOS AMI)
Hybrid AMI

40 - What are Key-Pairs in AWS?

The Key-Pairs are password-protected login credentials for the Virtual Machines that are used to prove our identity while connecting the Amazon EC2 instances.
The Key-Pairs are made up of a Private Key and a Public Key which lets us connect to the instances.

41 - what EBS Volumes

>>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. 
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances
>>it is permanent storage/persistance
>>it can be increased to max of 16TB you can't decreased the ebs
>>it is availble in SSD and HDD

disadvantages:-

>>click on next done
>>if you upload data in the bucket of anji256 the data will save in the bucket of anji159

49 - Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?

Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, 
developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services that make up AWS

These include moving backups to the cloud, using on-premises file shares backed by cloud storage, and providing low-latency access to 
data in AWS for on-premises applications.

>>volume-gateway:- Volume Gateways allow you to have point-in-time backups of your volumes stored as EBS snapshots, and come in two different operational modes: 
stored and cached. Stored volumes make your entire data available locally on the gateway, while maintaining an asynchronous copy in the S3 bucket

>>Storage-gateway:- You can use Storage Gateway to simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases. These include moving backups 
to the cloud, using on-premises file shares backed by cloud storage, and providing low-latency access to data in AWS for on-premises applications

>>8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 this ip address and dns is given by google itself this two ipaddress owned by google. its given by free by google
>>dns used to convert domain name to ip address.if you given gogle.com url bar the dns is converting google.com to ip address and search google.com
>>in your real time your isp will give dns address
>>most orgnazation disable ping to stop the ddos attacks by hackers
>>rembering name is easy but number are diffcult that we using dns names

58 - what is hostname resolution 

>>HostName resolution is the process of associating names and IP addresses, and it's one of the most essential services on a network. 
People understand descriptive names, but network communications require difficult-to-remember addresses

59 - what is fqdn

>>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is the complete domain name for a specific computer, or host, on the internet. 
The FQDN consists of two parts: the hostname and the domain name. For example, an FQDN for a hypothetical mail server 
might be mymail.somecollege.edu

60 - what is cloud-watch

>>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, 
and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources

61 - What services can be used to create a centralized logging solution?

>>The essential services that you can use are Amazon CloudWatch Logs, store them in Amazon S3, and then use Amazon Elastic Search to visualize them.
You can use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to move the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon ElasticSearch.

62 - What are the native AWS Security logging capabilities?

>>Most of the AWS services have their logging options. Also, some of them have an account level logging, like in AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and others.
Let’s take a look at two services in specific:

1-AWS CloudTrail:
>>cloudtrail is used to see th login logut details and activitesits not give detailed information

2-AWS Config:
>>AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration 
change notifications to enable security and governance.

63 - What is a DDoS attack, and what services can minimize them?

AWS WAF
Amazon Route53
Amazon CloudFront
ELB
VPC

64 - What is geo-targeting in CloudFront?

Geo-Targeting is a concept where businesses can show personalized content to their audience based on their geographic location without changing the URL. This helps you 
create customized content for the audience of a specific geographical area, keeping their needs in the forefront.

65 - What is CDN and how it works?

>>A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the 
internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.

66 - what is cloudtrail

>>cloudtrail is used to see th login logut details and activitesits not give detailed information
>>cloudtrail is data will save only 90 days, so we can import that into aws s3 or any centrailzied locatons

and virtual machines (VMs). SSM Agent makes it possible for Systems Manager to update, manage, and configure these resources

69 - What is load balancer and how it works? and types of load balancer

A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests 
in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance

1- Network load balancer
>>A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 
instances.This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.

>>it is an layer 4 in transpot layer 
>>it is use or support all protocals
rdp,ssh,http,https

2- Application load balancer

A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as 
EC2 instances,in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application

>>it is layer 7 in application layer
>>it uses only few protocals
https,http

70 - what is cross-zone load-balancer

>>The nodes for your load balancer distribute requests from clients to registered targets. When cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each load balancer 
node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones

71 - what is ssl-off loading or 

>>SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting encrypted traffic before passing it along to a web server.
            or
>>An SSL connection sends encrypted data between an end-user's computer and web server by using a certificate for authentication. 
SSL termination helps speed the decryption process and reduces the processing burden on backend servers

72 - what is round-robin load balancer              -->video 17 40mins

>>Round-robin DNS is a technique of load distribution, load balancing, or fault-tolerance provisioning multiple, redundant Internet Protocol service hosts, 
e.g., Web server, FTP servers, by managing the Domain Name System's (DNS) responses to address requests from client computers according to an appropriate 
statistical model        (or)
>>Round robin load balancing is a simple way to distribute client requests across a group of servers. A client request is forwarded to each server in turn.

How does it works:
>>What Is Round-Robin Load Balancing? Round‑robin load balancing is one of the simplest methods for distributing client requests across a group of servers. 
Going down the list of servers in the group, the round‑robin load balancer forwards a client request to each server in turn.

73 - what is target group in load balancer
>>collections of machines and also port
         or
>>A target group tells a load balancer where to direct traffic to : EC2 instances, fixed IP addresses; or AWS Lambda functions, amongst others. When creating a 
load balancer, you create one or more listeners and configure listener rules to direct the traffic to one target group

74 - what is the use of health checks in aws

>>Health checks are a way of asking a service on a particular server whether or not it is capable of performing work successfully. 
Load balancers ask each server this question periodically to determine which servers it is safe to direct traffic to.

75 - Your business prefers to use its email address and domain to send and receive compliance emails. What service do you recommend to implement it easily 
and budget-friendly?

>>This can be accomplished by using Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), a cloud-based   email-sending service.

76 - Describe SES.

>>Amazon offers the Simple Email Service (SES) service, which allows you to send bulk emails to customers swiftly at a minimal cost.
 
77 - what is IAM

>>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated 
(signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

78 - what are the types IAM policies    -->see in iam.txt read inline policy
>>aws managed policy
>>user managed policy
>>inline policy it is not visible for everyone it is specific for user only or groups only

79 - what is IAM policy simulator?
>>Iam policy simulator is used to see the policy briefly what you attached to the users for permisiions what you given

80 - can you describe in-line-policy
>>ec2:describe* is nothing but seeing or readonly for all ec2 action
             or
>>An inline policy is a policy that's embedded in an IAM identity (a user, group, or role). That is, the policy is an inherent part of the identity.
 You can create a policy and embed it in an identity, either when you create the identity or later.

81 - where we can use roles
>>Roles are a common approach to handling authorization and permissions in a web application. For example, it's common to create an Administrator role that gives 
admin users more permissions or power than normal users. In this project, you'll add a Manage Users page that only administrators can see.

82 - what is role-switching
>>When you switch to a role, you temporarily give up your user permissions and work with the permissions that are assigned to the role. 
When you exit the role, your user permissions are automatically restored

83 - ho you can manage the 20 accounts as acccounts
>>we can use orgnzation create the some group to add and divide specific groups to aws accounts
                              (or)
>>if we have 20 accounts we use master and sub-account architecture we use. master is there we use organzations, properly use organzation units we kept as internal
external and third party we are properly segrgated. then we can apply security control policy ,we can restrict users using permisiion boundary

84 - how to secure your system or aws accounts how to see logs 
>>using cloud trail feature enable it send the logs into s3 bucket

85 - What is RDS AWS used for?
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed SQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Amazon RDS supports an array of database engines to store and organize data. It also helps with relational database management tasks, 
such as data migration, backup, recovery and patching.

86 - what is the rds failover time
>>60-120 seconds

87 -rds database tpes

1-master(primary)
2-read(secondary)replica       -->you can create read replica

>>some tester has come and asked we have test the rds your not giving the primary you dont
know how to access the secondary that time you can use the read replica
>>read replica just copy a primary you can put another region also
>>in read replica you can't do write on database its only read option

88. Will your standby RDS be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?

No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. This is because the entire purpose
of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure. As a result, if the primary instance fails, the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data.

89 - How would you address a situation in which the relational database engine frequently collapses when traffic to your RDS instances increases, given that the RDS instance replica
is not promoted as the master instance?

>>A larger RDS instance type is required for handling significant quantities of traffic, as well as producing manual or automated snapshots to recover data if the 
RDS instance fails

90 - What is auto-scaling?

Auto-scaling is a function that allows you to provision and launch new instances whenever there is a demand. It allows you to automatically increase or decrease 
resource capacity in relation to the demand.Cloud Architect Master's

91 - what is SNS

>>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and 
consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel

92 - what is deregistration delay
>>Elastic Load Balancing stops sending requests to targets that are deregistering. By default, Elastic Load Balancing waits 300 seconds before completing the 
deregistration process,which can help in-flight requests to the target to complete
         or
>>Connection draining allows you to specify a maximum time (between 1 and 3,600 seconds and default 300 seconds) to keep the connections alive before reporting the
instance as de-registered. The maximum timeout limit does not apply to connections to unhealthy instances.

93 - What is Inspector in AWS

>>Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

94 - what is lambda and what is use of lambda

>>Lambda runs your code on high availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of your compute resources. This includes server and 
operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging.

95 - What is Elastic Beanstaclk

>>AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services for deploying applications which orchestrates various AWS services, 
including EC2, S3, Simple Notification Service, CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers

>>Elastic beanstaclk is used  if the developer is developing java application he is checking and deploying in 3 days in a week so we can use elastic beanstaclk
using create servers and required configuration easily

96 - what is global acclerator

>> AWS Global Accelerator ingresses traffic from the edge location that is closest to your end clients through anycast static IP addresses. Then traffic traverses 
the congestion-free and redundant AWS global network, which optimizes the path to your application that is running in an AWS Region

97 - what is WAF in AWS

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP(S) requests that are forwarded to your protected web application resources. 
You can protect the following resource types: Amazon CloudFront distribution

98 - what is cognito

>>Amazon Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and authentication to your mobile and web apps. Amazon Cognito also enables you to authenticate users through an 
external identity provider and provides temporary security credentials to access your app's backend resources in AWS or any service behind Amazon API Gateway

>>you can intregrate the third-party signin and login functionalitys

99 - what is docker-ECR

>>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports 
private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM

100 - what is cloud-formation (it is infrastructure as a code)(IAAS)

>>AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS 
and third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion
                                   (or)
>>AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. You can create templates for the service or application architectures you want 
and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”).

---Advantages
>>CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, 
all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third-party resources.

---Disadvantages
>>CloudFormation uses either JSON or YAML. This makes CloudFormation easy to read and manage. But there is a constraint that doesn't allow AWS developers to 
create CloudFormation templates greater than 51MB in size. In case the template exceeds this size limit, developers need to create a nested stack for the templates.

>we can use this template to create the services we can use this code to version control and if we can modify the code we can easily undesrstand
>>aws cloud-formation uses YAML and JSON lanugauge
>>Save the code in an S3 bucket, which serves as a repository for the code.
>>Use AWS CloudFormation to call the bucket and create a stack on your template

101 - if the replacement is true in cloud-formation

>>in cloud formation when your are deployed one server and then changed key pair or something nything in your cloud-formation and importing in resource 
through updating when its come true means it will destroy the server or ec2-system and install fresh system or ec2 or resource. 
if it comes false then it update the system or resources

102 - what is import-resource in cloud-formation

>>in cloud formation import-resource using. when you acccidentaly created ec2-instance manualy by mistake without deleeting that
you can import that resource using the Import-resource option but you must mention "deletionpolicy": "retain" is mandatory and if you want destory that system using
cloud-formation means first system will delete but next time add system not gone delete because it will using retain policy

103 - what is roolback failure in cloud-formation

>>roll-back failure is must be enable. when your deploying code using cloud-formation if gets an error then automatically delete the everything what is deployed 
in cloud-formation 

104 - what is designer in cloud-formation

>>AWS CloudFormation Designer (Designer) is a graphic tool for creating, viewing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates. With Designer, you can diagram your 
template  resources using a drag-and-drop interface, and then edit their details using the integrated JSON and YAML editor

105 - what is stack policy in cloud-formation

>>stack-policy is used to restrict the updates of your cloud-formation templates of any user anyone

106 - what is nested template in cloud-formation

>>nested stack using you can create multiple resource like 3 differnet vpc inside the 3 servers using centrailized url or your cloud formation stored or saved 
in somewhere s3 any where 

107 - what is stackset in cloud-formation

>>stacksets using can deploy cloud-formation using the resources in different accounts . this accounts added in your orgnaztion , first need to create the stackset 
role and then create the stack-set execcution rule and give master account id and do same in sub-accounts and give master account id and then copy the ou id 
and then deploy your resources in other accounts if you added two more accounts that accounts also deployed that resources

108 - what is detect drift in cloud-formation

>>detect drift is used to identify what is changes done when you deployed in cloud-formation configuration it detect and show you either you can add or delete further
                          (or)
>>Drift is the difference between the expected configuration values of stack resources defined in CloudFormation templates and the actual configuration values of these 
resources in the corresponding CloudFormation stacks.

109 - what is code smell

>>Code smells indicate a deeper problem, but as the name suggests, they are sniffable or quick to spot. The best smell is something easy to find but 
will lead to an interesting problem, like classes with data and no behavior.

110 -what JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

>>It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, 
so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

111 - can you explain 3tier architecture or elbrate them
>>first we have extranal load balancer and internal load balancer then the extranal load balancer is open to the internet
through route53 and internal load balancer is between app and web and the app is connected to database

>>using public and private subnets

112 - what is YAML

>>YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted

113 - What is SQL Server in simple words?
