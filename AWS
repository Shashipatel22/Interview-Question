1 - Define and explain the three basic types of cloud services and the AWS products that are built based on them?

>>The three basic types of cloud services are:

Computing
Storage
Networking
Here are some of the AWS products that are built based on the three cloud service types:

Computing - These include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto-Scaling, and Lightsat.

Storage - These include S3, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System.

Networking - These include VPC, Amazon CloudFront, Route53

2 - What is the relation between the Availability Zone and Region?

>>AWS regions are separate geographical areas, like the US-West 1 (North California) and Asia South (Mumbai). On the other hand, availability zones
are the areas that are present inside the regions. These are generally isolated zones that can replicate themselves whenever required.

3 - what is code smell

>>Code smells indicate a deeper problem, but as the name suggests, they are sniffable or quick to spot. The best smell is something easy to find but 
will lead to an interesting problem, like classes with data and no behavior.

4 - what is cloud-watch

>>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, 
and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources

5 - what is cloud-formation (it is infrastructure as a code)(IAAS)

>>AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS 
and third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion
                                   (or)
>>AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. You can create templates for the service or application architectures you want 
and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”).

>we can use this template to create the services we can use this code to version control and if we can modify the code we can easily undesrstand
>>aws cloud-formation uses YAML and JSON lanugauge
>>Save the code in an S3 bucket, which serves as a repository for the code.
>>Use AWS CloudFormation to call the bucket and create a stack on your template

6 - what JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
>>It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, 
so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

7 - what is YAML

>>YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted

8 - what is virtual machines

>>In computing, a virtual machine is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer.
Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination

9 - what is VPC

>>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security.
Get started by setting up your VPC in the AWS service console

Amazon VPC offers two different types of endpoints: gateway type endpoints and interface type endpoints.

10 - what is hostname resolution 

>>HostName resolution is the process of associating names and IP addresses, and it's one of the most essential services on a network. 
People understand descriptive names, but network communications require difficult-to-remember addresses

11 - what is fqdn

>>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is the complete domain name for a specific computer, or host, on the internet. 
The FQDN consists of two parts: the hostname and the domain name. For example, an FQDN for a hypothetical mail server 
might be mymail.somecollege.edu

12 - Is there any other alternative tool to log into the cloud environment other than console?

Putty
AWS CLI for Linux
AWS CLI for Windows
AWS CLI for Windows CMD
AWS SDK
Eclipse

13 - What services can be used to create a centralized logging solution?

>>The essential services that you can use are Amazon CloudWatch Logs, store them in Amazon S3, and then use Amazon Elastic Search to visualize them.
You can use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to move the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon ElasticSearch.

14 - What are the native AWS Security logging capabilities?

>>Most of the AWS services have their logging options. Also, some of them have an account level logging, like in AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and others.
Let’s take a look at two services in specific:

1-AWS CloudTrail
2-AWS Config

15 - What is a DDoS attack, and what services can minimize them?

>>DDoS is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator accesses a website and creates multiple sessions so that the other legitimate users cannot access the service.
The native tools that can help you deny the DDoS attacks on your AWS services are:

AWS Shield
AWS WAF
Amazon Route53
Amazon CloudFront
ELB
VPC

16 - You are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?

>>Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. 
They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don’t see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn’t been published in your region yet. 
However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services

17 - What are the different types of virtualization in AWS, and what are the differences between them?

>>Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
It is a fully virtualized hardware, where all the virtual machines act separate from each other. These virtual machines boot by executing a master boot record 
in the root block device of your image.
>>Paravirtualization (PV)
Paravirtualization-GRUB is the bootloader that boots the PV AMIs. The PV-GRUB chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.
>>Paravirtualization on HVM
PV on HVM helps operating systems take advantage of storage and network I/O available through the host.

18 - Name some of the AWS services that are not region-specific

>>AWS services that are not region-specific are:

IAM
Route 53
Web Application Firewall 
CloudFront

19 - What are the differences between NAT Gateways and NAT Instances?

NAT-gateway: -NAT Gateway is a highly available AWS managed service that makes it easy to connect to the Internet from instances within a private subnet in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). 
Previously, you needed to launch a NAT instance to enable NAT for instances in a private subnet.

differnece:-
1 - nat gateway managed by aws 
2 - nat gateway canot assigned security groups
3 - nat gateway highly availble
4 - nat gateway bandwidth is upto 45 mbps
5 - nat gateway perfomance is good

NAT-A NAT (Network Address Translation) instance is, like a bastion host, an EC2 instance that lives in your public subnet. A NAT instance, however, allows your private instances outgoing connectivity
to the internet while at the same time blocking inbound traffic from the internet

differnece:-
1 - nat instance managed by you
2 - nat instance can assignes security groups
3 - nat instance is also highly availble
4 - nat instance bandwidth is depends on instnace bandwidth
5 - nat instance performance compared to nat gateway is average

20 - what is authentication and authriozation

>>authentication your accessing or login into the applicatio or portal entry only

>>authrozation is nothing but you should be assign some roles are features

21 - Define Amazon EC2 regions and availability zones?

>>Availability zones are geographically separate locations. As a result, failure in one zone has no effect on EC2 instances in other zones. When it comes to regions, they may have one or more availability zones.
This configuration also helps to reduce latency and costs

22 - Explain Amazon EC2 root device volume?

>>The image that will be used to boot an EC2 instance is stored on the root device drive. This occurs when an Amazon AMI runs a new EC2 instance. And this root device volume is supported by EBS or an instance store. 
In general, the root device data on Amazon EBS is not affected by the lifespan of an EC2 instance

23 - Mention the different types of instances in  Amazon EC2 and explain its features.

>>General Purpose Instances: They are used to compute a range of workloads and aid in the allocation of processing, memory, and networking resources.
>>Compute Optimized Instances: These are ideal for compute-intensive applications. They can handle  batch processing workloads, high-performance web servers, machine learning inference, and various other tasks
>>Memory Optimized: They process workloads that handle massive datasets in memory and deliver them quickly.
>>Accelerated Computing: It aids in the execution of floating-point number calculations, data pattern matching, and graphics processing. These functions are carried out using hardware accelerators.
>>Storage Optimised: They handle tasks that require sequential read and write access to big data sets on local storage

24 - Will your standby RDS be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?

>>No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. This is because the entire purpose of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure.
As a result, if the primary instance fails, the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data

25 - What is the difference between a Spot Instance, an On-demand Instance, and a Reserved Instance?

>>Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that users can use at a reduced cost.

>>When you use on-demand instances, you must pay for computing resources without making long-term obligations.

Reserved instances, on the other hand, allow you to specify attributes such as instance type, platform, tenancy, region, and availability zone. 
Reserved instances offer significant reductions and capacity reservations when instances in certain availability zones are used.
