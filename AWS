3 - what is code smell

>>Code smells indicate a deeper problem, but as the name suggests, they are sniffable or quick to spot. The best smell is something easy to find but 
will lead to an interesting problem, like classes with data and no behavior.

5 - what is cloud-formation (it is infrastructure as a code)(IAAS)

>>AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS 
and third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion
                                   (or)
>>AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. You can create templates for the service or application architectures you want 
and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”).

---Advantages
>>CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, 
all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third-party resources.

---Disadvantages
>>CloudFormation uses either JSON or YAML. This makes CloudFormation easy to read and manage. But there is a constraint that doesn't allow AWS developers to 
create CloudFormation templates greater than 51MB in size. In case the template exceeds this size limit, developers need to create a nested stack for the templates.

>we can use this template to create the services we can use this code to version control and if we can modify the code we can easily undesrstand
>>aws cloud-formation uses YAML and JSON lanugauge
>>Save the code in an S3 bucket, which serves as a repository for the code.
>>Use AWS CloudFormation to call the bucket and create a stack on your template

6 - what is clouf-formation designer

7 - what is stackset in cloud-formation

8 - what is drifting in cloud-formation

9 - what is stack policy in cloud-formation

10 - what is detect drift in cloud-formation

11 - what is nested template in cloud-formation


12 - if the replacement is true in cloud-formation

>>in cloud formation when your are deployed one server and then changed key pair or something nything in your cloud-formation and importing in resource 
through updating when its come true means it will destroy the server or ec2-system and install fresh system or ec2 or resource. 
if it comes false then it update the system or resources

13 - what is import-resource in cloud-formation

>>in cloud formation import-resource using. when you acccidentaly created ec2-instance manualy by mistake without deleeting that
you can import that resource using the Import-resource option but you must mention "deletionpolicy": "retain" is mandatory and if you want destory that system using
cloud-formation means first system will delete but next time add system not gone delete because it will using retain policy

14 - what is roolback failure in cloud-formation

>>roll-back failure is must be enable. when your deploying code using cloud-formation if gets an error then automatically delete the everything what is deployed in cloud-formation 

6 - what JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
>>It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, 
so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

7 - what is YAML

>>YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted

24 - Will your standby RDS be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?

>>No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. This is because the entire purpose of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure.
As a result, if the primary instance fails, the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data

26 - How would you address a situation in which the relational database engine frequently collapses when traffic to your RDS instances increases, given that the RDS instance replica is not promoted as the master instance?

>>A larger RDS instance type is required for handling significant quantities of traffic, as well as producing manual or automated snapshots to recover data if the RDS instance fails

3. What is auto-scaling?

Auto-scaling is a function that allows you to provision and launch new instances whenever there is a demand. It allows you to automatically increase or decrease resource capacity in relation to the demand.
Cloud Architect Master's

54 - What is RDS AWS used for?
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed SQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Amazon RDS supports an array of database engines to store and organize data. It also helps with relational database management tasks, 
such as data migration, backup, recovery and patching.

53 - what is the rds failover time
>>60-120 seconds

55 -rds database tpes
1-master(primary)
2-read(secondary)replica       -->you can create read replica
>>some tester has come and asked we have test the rds your not giving the primary you dont
know how to access the secondary that time you can use the read replica
>>read replica just copy a primary you can put another region also

>>in read replica you can't do write on database its only read option

23. Will your standby RDS be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?
No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. This is because the entire purpose of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure. As a result, if the primary instance fails, the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data.

51 - what is lambda and what is use of lambda

>>Lambda runs your code on high availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of your compute resources. This includes server and operating system maintenance, 
capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging.

52 - What is Inspector in AWS

>>Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

59 - what is AWS Service Catalog
>>AWS Service Catalog enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for AWS. 
These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, databases, and more to complete multi-tier application architectures

60 - what is SNS

>>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers).
 Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel

61 - how you can handle 20 aws accounts

>>if we have 20 accounts we use master and sub-account architecture we use. master is there we use
organzations, properly use organzation units we kept as internal external and third party
we are properly segrgated. then we can apply security control policy ,we can restrict users using permisiion boundary

62 - What is Inspector in AWS

>>Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

65 - can you explain 3tier architecture or elbrate them
>>first we have extranal load balancer and internal load balancer then the extranal load balancer is open to the internet
through route53 and internal load balancer is between app and web and the app is connected to database

>>using public and private subnets

66 - what is deregistration delay
>>Elastic Load Balancing stops sending requests to targets that are deregistering. By default, Elastic Load Balancing waits 300 seconds before completing the deregistration process,
which can help in-flight requests to the target to complete
         or
>>Connection draining allows you to specify a maximum time (between 1 and 3,600 seconds and default 300 seconds) to keep the connections alive before reporting the instance as de-registered. 
The maximum timeout limit does not apply to connections to unhealthy instances.
